## User Experience (UX)
The user experience for this project is divided into two sections to address varying user needs and expectations: new users and frequent visitors.

#### New Users 
As a new user:
- When the game loads, I want it to be visually appealing and easy to navigate so that I can start playing immediately without the requirement of creating an account.
- The menu should be easily accessible and intuitive. 
- When starting a new game, there should be clear instructions on how to play the game and how to control the movement of the snake using arrow keys on the keyboard, so that I can navigate the snake around the game board.
-  I would like to easily access the scoreboard to view high scores,compare scores with other users or see how I'm doing compared to others.
- I would like to have the option to restart the game after it ends.

#### Frequent Visitors
As a frequent visitor:
- If I am not able to complete a level within one try, I want to be able to continue where I left off when I return.
- I want the game to remember my previous high score, so that I can track my progress and strive to beat my own record.
- Explore advanced gameplay features such as power-ups, obstacles, or different game modes to enhance the gaming experience.
- Compete with other players on the leaderboard to maintain or improve ranking position.

## Features
